Mathematics Compulsory Part Paper 1
General Marking Instructions
1. It is very important that all markers should adhere as closely as possible to the marking scheme. In many
cases, however, candidates will have obtained a correct answer by an alternative method not specified in the
marking scheme. In general, a correct answer merits all the marks allocated to that part, unless a particular
method has been specified in the question. Markers should be patient in marking alternative solutions not
specified in the marking scheme.
2. In the marking scheme, marks are classified into the following three categories:
'M' marks awarded for correct methods being used;
'A' marks awarded for the accuracy of the answers;
Marks without 'M' or 'A' awarded for correctly completing a proof or arriving
at an answer given in a question.
In a question consisting of several parts each depending on the previous parts, 'M' marks should be awarded
to steps or methods correctly deduced from previous answers, even if these answers are erroneous. However,
'A' marks for the corresponding answers should NOT be awarded (unless otherwise specified).
3. For the convenience of markers, the marking scheme was written as detailed as possible. However, it is still
likely that candidates would not present their solution in the same explicit manner, e.g. some steps would
either be omitted or stated implicitly. In such cases, markers should exercise their discretion in marking
candidates' work. In general, marks for a certain step should be awarded if candidates' solution indicated that
the relevant concept/technique had been used.
4. In marking candidates' work, the benefit of doubt should be given in the candidates' favour.
5. In the marking scheme, 'r.t.' stands for 'accepting answers which can be rounded off to' and 'f.t.' stands for
'follow through'. Steps which can be skipped are shaded whereas alternative answers are enclosed with
rectangles. All fractional answers must be simplified.

Solution
14. (a) Let p(x) = (mx+n)(x²-2x+3)+x+13, where m and n are constants.
Therefore, we have p(x) = mx³+(n-2m)x² + (3m-2n+1)x+3n+13.
So, we have m=2 and 3n+13=-20.
Solving, we have m=2 and n=-11.
Hence, we have p(x) = 2x³-15x2+29x-20.
Thus, we have a-15 and b = 29.

So, the quadratic equation 2x2-5x+4 = 0 has no real roots.

3
The required equation is
y-12=-(x-158)
4x+3y-6680
(b) The radius of C is 75.
Since 83+75=158, AP is vertical or AQ is vertical.
So, the coordinates of P or the coordinates of Q are (158,112).
Note that AAGP = AAGQ and AGPQ.
Hence, the slope of PQ is
The equation of PQ is y-112=(x-158).
3
4
Solving y-112=(x-158) and 4x+3y-6680, we have
x=110 and y = 76.
Thus, the coordinates of the point of intersection of AG and PQ are (110, 76).
(c) Let I andr be the centre and the radius of the inscribed circle of AAPQ respectively.
Note that AP AQ and I lies on AG.
The x-coordiante of I

The y-coordinate of I

So, the coordinates of I are (158-r, +12).
The distance between I and the point of intersection of AG and PQ is r.
((158-r)-110)2 + ((+12)-76)2 = r²

r2-150r+3 600 = 0
r = 30 or r = 120 (rejected)
Therefore, we have r = 30
Hence, the coordinates of I are (128,52).
Thus, the required equation is (x-128)2+(y-52)2 = 302.
